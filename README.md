# Elegant iOS pullout menu with javascript

This is a very simple and lightweight pullout menu to simulate what you find in many iOS apps.

I have added support for jQuery as well as vanilla JS.

The pullout feature only works on iOS, or whatever environment supports 'touchstart', 'touchmove' and 'touchend' events in javascript.

## Demo
Here is a [demo](http://demo.mooschmedia.com/ios-pullout-menu/ "Demo").

### Support

I've tested on the following device browsers:

Safari (iPhone 5) - Works
Chrome (iPhone 5) - Works

Safari (iPad) - Works
Chrome (iPad) - Works

This is just a first version, so expect some cleaner code to come
